  <h2>TITLE: Coworker Overdosing</h2>

  <br>
  <p> A bit of a dreary first entry, but today one of my coworkers came into work overdosing on... something. <br> </p>
  <p> Figured I'd write about it since it's still on my mind, and honestly I'm still quite shaken by it. <br> </p>
  <p> The guy was usually nice, and really he didn't seem to come off as a user. I was surprised when I turned the corner today and saw him just standing there; lifeless. <br> </p>
  <p> Me and a few coworkers had to pull the guy off the kisok and into the kitchen, where I then vigorously rubbed his chest to keep his heart and lungs going. <br> </p>
  <p> I feel like I did something, though I'm not sure I did. Coworkers tell me I did so I guess so. Paramedics came, gave narcan, and off he went. <br> </p>
  <p> I called around to nearby hospitals to see if he was ok, he was stable thank god, but I was still worried about him. <br> </p>
  <p> Drugs are scary fucking things; pray I never get caught up in that. <br> </p>
