  <h1>WHERE I GET MY SOUNDS</h1>
  <p> I come from an electronic / synthwave background, listening mainly to creators such as Home, Voyager, Carpenter Brut, etc. <br> </p>
  <p> Lyrically I take a lot off of Thom Yorke and Elliot Smith's style of writing, abstract but not without meaning. <br> </p>
  <p> A lot of what I do write comes from personal experiences and thoughts, nothing is ingenuine here. <br> </p>
